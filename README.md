## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **API:** Spoonacular Recipe API  

## 🌐 API Usage (Important)

This project uses the **Spoonacular API**, which has a request and quota limit.

To stay within the API limits:
- The number of recipes displayed per request is **intentionally limited**
- Result caps are used to reduce excessive API calls

This ensures better performance and avoids exceeding the API’s daily quota.
